## What was done in this project(Description):
* The main focus of this project was Practicing and implementing the use of react-router & firebase Authentication. So, I applied  React-router to navigate pages from one place to another .
* Also Implemented Login and signup with Email-password , google , github with the help of firebase.
* I implemented an Icon-button to make a pdf page of Course-details with the help of the "react-to-pdf" package.
*  There is also added a Feature of Private route while users will checkout for purchasing the course. If a user is not logged in he/she can't go to the checkout page until the user gets logged in.
* In some portions I have used the react "useContext" hook to distribute the user data and the others function through the Project code and files.
*  There many kinds of functionalities have been implemented , most importantly "useAuthStateChange '' for holding the state of the user and the unSubscribe function for preventing memory leak.
* Lastly, I tried to implement toggling and dark and day themes and used many kinds of hooks and react-icons and so on. so that the site looks nice and meaningful.
